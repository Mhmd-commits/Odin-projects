    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>a dessert originating from medieval Europe, made of whole or pieces of fruit in sugar syrup"></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups mixed berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon lemon zest (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water (optional, if needed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Berries</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using fresh berries, wash and hull them as needed. If using frozen berries, you can use them directly without thawing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Compote</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the berries, sugar, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the berries release their juices and the mixture starts to thicken, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>If the compote is too thick, you can add a tablespoon of water to thin it out. If it's too thin, continue cooking to reduce it further.</li>
        <li>For extra flavor, stir in the lemon zest towards the end of cooking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the compote from the heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or chilled over pancakes, waffles, yogurt, ice cream, or desserts. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
